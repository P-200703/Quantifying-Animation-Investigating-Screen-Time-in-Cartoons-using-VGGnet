Abstract: The purpose of this project is to create a sophisticated video analyzing system tailored with cartoon content in consideration .This method aims to monitor the presence of characters and movements in various animated narratives through the utilization of runtime assessment, recognition of objects, and data collection. The study's major purpose is to reveal the surprising aspect of character connections, movement sequences, and screen time arrangement by separating up the content frame by frame. The goal of this study is to provide informative data regarding audience engagement and the significance of distinct characters.
Algorithms based on deep learning can be employed to calculate the screen time assigned to performers in the footage, thus offers many possibilities, such as determining actor payment, analyzing gender discrimination in movies, and developing innovative video modifying technologies. The methodology strongly emphasizes the significance and allocation of screen time for characters. This study can identify which characters have important or significant roles in the plot through looking at the allocation of screen time among distinct characters, providing a more comprehensive understanding of character interactions.

Keywords: frame-by-frame content, communication patterns, character prominence, content optimization, and video analytics.
